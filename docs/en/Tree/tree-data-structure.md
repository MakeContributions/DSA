# Tree:

**Tree** is a non-linear simple hierarchical data structure for which average time complexity is O(log<sub>2</sub>n). If time complexity in worst case becomes O(n), then it can be converted into O(log<sub>2</sub>n) with some modification.

**Tree** is also called recursive data structure. The topmost node of the tree is called the root, and the nodes below it are called the child nodes. Each node can have multiple child nodes, and these child nodes can also have their own child nodes, forming a recursive structure.


Top most node of the tree is called root and all the nodes below root is called child notes. All the nodes wich does not have any child is called leave nodes.

# Basic terminology in Tree Data Structure:



- **Root Node:** The top most node of the tree is called root node. Root node does not have any parent. In the above image {A} is the root of the tree.
