## Contribution Guidelines
### 1. Folders or files naming
The folder or file should have the below conditions:
- The name should be in lower case.
- The word should be separate with a **dash(-)**.
- When have new topic should create a new folder and index for it.
- A new file should add to the **index(README.md)** using [relative links](https://compugoddess.com/relative-vs-absolute-links/)
- It can only contain **dash(-)** it cannot have other specific characters.

For example:
```
DSA
  | searching
    | readme.md -> should create an readme for the index
    | c-or-cpp
      | linear-search.cpp
      | binary-search.cpp
    | python
      | linear-search.py
      | binary-search.py
    | csharp
      | linear-search.cs
      | binary-search.cs
```
### 2. Naming Convention
The programming should keep the naming convention rule of each programming language
