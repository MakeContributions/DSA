// Ugly numbers are numbers whose only prime factors are 2, 3 or 5. The sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, â€¦ shows the first 11 ugly numbers.
// By convention, 1 is included. Write a program to find Nth Ugly Number

// Algorithm :
// Initialize three-pointers two, three, and five pointing to zero.
// Take 3 variables nm2, nm3, and nm5 to keep track of next multiple of 2,3 and 5.
// Make an array of size n to store the ugly numbers with 1 at 0th index.
// Initialize a variable next which stores the value of the last element in the array.
// Run a loop n-1 times and perform steps 6,7 and 8.
// Update the values of nm2, nm3, nm5 as ugly[two]*2, ugly[three]*3, ugly[5]*5 respectively.
// Select the minimum value from nm2, nm3, and nm5 and increment the pointer related to it.
// Store the minimum value in variable next and array.
// Return next.
