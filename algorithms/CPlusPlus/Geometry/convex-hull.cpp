/*
Given a set of points in the plane. the convex hull of the set is the smallest convex polygon that contains all the points of it.


Algorithm:
Step 1) Initialize p as leftmost point. 
Step 2) Do following while we donâ€™t come back to the first (or leftmost) point. 
            2.1) The next point q is the point, such that the triplet (p, q, r) is counter clockwise for any other point r. 

                    To find this, we simply initialize q as next point, then we traverse through all points. 

                    For any point i, if i is more counter clockwise, i.e., orientation(p, i, q) is counter clockwise, then we update q as i. 

                    Our final value of q is going to be the most counter clockwise point. 
           2.2) next[p] = q (Store q as next of p in the output convex hull). 
           2.3) p = q (Set p as q for next iteration).

Output: The output is points of the convex hull. 
 

(0, 3)
(0, 0)
(3, 0)
(3, 3)


Time Complexity:  O(m * n), where n is number of input points and m is number of output or hull points (m <= n).  For every point on the hull we examine all the other points to determine the next point.

Worst case, Time complexity: O(n2).  The worst case occurs when all the points are on the hull (m = n).

Auxiliary Space: O(n), since n extra space has been taken.
Set 2- Convex Hull (Graham  Scan) 

Note : The above code may produce different results for different order of inputs, when there are collinear points in the convex hull. For example, it produces output as (0, 3) (0, 0) (3, 0) (3, 3) for input (0, 3), (0, 0), (0, 1), (3, 0), (3, 3) and output as (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 0) (3, 0) (3, 3) for input as (0, 3), (0, 1), (0, 0), (3, 0), (3, 3). We generally need the farthest next point in case of collinear, we can get the desired result in case of collinear points by adding one more if condition.
